This study investigates the influence of fractional forest cover on annual precipitation, evapotranspiration, and land surface temperature, comparing areas of primary forest with those of secondary forest. In addition, we examine how secondary forests at different successional stages contribute to local climate regulation (within 1 km × 1 km grid cells) across three regions of the Brazilian Amazon: central (CBA), eastern (EBA), and southern (SBA).
